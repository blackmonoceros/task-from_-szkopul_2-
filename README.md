D'artagnan without musketeers

D'artagnan announced a competition for 3 musketeers. Unfortunately, there were a lot of
interested people. Even a million!

Powers
D'artagnan stated that he was unable to check all the candidates. Fortunately,
each candidate provided their power, which can also be negative.

Will you help?
D'artagnan asked you to list the 10 best candidates and list their
powers. Input
The first line contains 1 number 1 ≤ 𝑙𝑖𝑐𝑧𝑏𝑎_𝑘𝑎𝑛𝑑𝑦𝑑𝑎𝑡𝑜𝑤 ≤ 1,000,000
representing the number of candidates for the 3 musketeers.
The second line contains 𝑙𝑖𝑐𝑧𝑏𝑎_𝑘𝑎𝑛𝑑𝑦𝑑𝑎𝑡𝑜𝑤 numbers from -1,000,000 to
1,000,000 representing the power of each candidate.
Output
Your program should print the powers of the 10 candidates with the highest values, 
sorted in descending order. Example 1
Input
12 (There are 12 candidates)
3 6 3 2 5 9 4 -1 -2 3 8 1 (Potencies of 12 candidates)
Output
9 8 6 5 4 3 3 3 2 1 (Potencies of top 10 candidates sorted descending)
